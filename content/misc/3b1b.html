<div id="video-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Video 1</h1>
<p>Start in the <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> coordinate plane. Define the basis vectors <span class="math inline">\(i=(1,0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j=(0,1)\)</span>. These are basis vectors. Note that any linear combination of the two basis vectors <span class="math inline">\(ai + bj\)</span> could reach any point on this plane. We call this set of achievable points the <strong>span</strong> of the two vectors.</p>
