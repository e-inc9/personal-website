Start in the `\((x,y)\)` coordinate plane. Define the basis vectors `\(i=(1,0)\)` and `\(j=(0,1)\)`. These are basis vectors. Note that any linear combination of the two basis vectors `\(ai + bj\)` could reach any point on this  plane. We call this set of achievable points the **span** of the two vectors.
